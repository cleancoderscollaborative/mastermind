        # Injecting mocks for Python packages is difficult because of the two ways that the package may be loaded.
        # If loaded with a straight import, replacing classes or functions is straightforward, just replace the
        # attribute with a new value. But we must assume that the client code is doing an 'from module import X',
        # and in that case the client code gets the value of X before it can be mocked. Since it is a local reference
        # now in the client code, mocking the original will not change X there. Worse, we have to load the client
        # code in the test suite before the mock because Python does not have a mechanism for hoisting the mock.
        #
        # The solution is "importlib", which allows us to simulate the hoist by reloading the imported code under
        # test (CUT) after the mock has been established, which causes it to re-import its dependencies and now
        # see the mock.
