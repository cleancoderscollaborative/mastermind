# Mastermind

If you stumbled across this repository without coming through the Clean Coders Collaberative
you are more than welcome to explore this!
In a nutshell Clean Coders Collaborative is a group that studies building better software.
If you want to learn more, visit the Meetup page at https://www.meetup.com/clean-mobile-code/.

## Overview

Implementing the Mastermind game will allow plenty of opportunities to discuss and experiment with TDD, Agile, and development principles
and patterns.
The environment has been chosen to focus on those topics, and not create a high learning curve to participate:

1. The game because it offers multiple opportunities for discussion.
1. Python is chosen because of the common C-like syntax, the prevalence
of use, and that both object-oriented and functional programming topcis may be addressed.
1. Visual Studio Code will be the IDE, because of the price tag, the available extensions, and it is the interface for GitHub Codespaces.
1. The project is configured in such a way as to be developed using a local Python installation or in a Codespace at GitHub if
you prefer not to (or cannot) install Python on your computer.

This repository will be updated with new program features as the project progresses through the Clean Coders Collaborative meetups
and the code is accepted by the participants.
See the [*Git Notes*](#git-notes) section below for instructions on cloning the repository, making pull requests, and updating
your GitHub and local copies to stay in sync with the meetup.

## Process

### Prior to the first meetup

1. Follow the [*Configuration*](#configuration) instructions to use either your local computer or a GitHub Codespace for development.
1. Optionally review the [Project Overview](#project-overview) and [Testing](#testing) guides blelow.
1. Review the rules for Mastermind: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)

### At the meetups

1. The group will be led by *champions* for the project.
The champions will pick the topic of discussion, and the group will develop code and talk
about making it better.
1. Gather requirements and define priorities.
1. Use TDD to start the project.
Agile will be incorported; if you are a Scrum connoisseur each meetup is a sprint, complete with a planning meeting at the beginning
and a retrospective at the end.
Remember that Agile, and even TDD, are not the focus of this project.
The focus is *Clean Code*.
1. If different teams work on aspects of the code, use separate branches for the work, push to your own
repository, and issue pull requests to
merge with the Clean Coders Collaborative repository.

## Configuration

As mentioned in the overview above, there are two options for the development environment:

* [Option 1: Local development environment (preferred)](#option-1-local-development-environment-preferred)
* [Option 2: Develop in a GitHub Codespace](#option-2-develop-in-a-github-codespace)

### Option 1: Local development environment (preferred)

1. At a terminal window or command prompt (all systems) check to see if you have Python 3.
$ is the command prompt.
There are three possible commands to check depending on your platform and
how python was installed, not every one will work if python is installed:
    ```
    $ python --version
    $ python3 --version
    $ py --version
    ```
1. If python is installed, make a note of which python command worked.
Throughout this guide we will just use *python* in the examples, but you need to replace
it with whatever the python command on your system is.
1. Check for *git*:
    ```
    $ git --version
    ```

#### Apple MacOS

1. Install Python 3 if you do not have it; three options:

1. Continue with [*All Platforms*](#all-platforms) below.

#### All Platforms

1. We recommend that you set up an SSH Key at GitHub to pull and push repository changes,
that will be much easier than using a password.
See the [Git Notes](#git-notes) section for details.
1. Launch VSCode.
If this is a new installation of VSCode, you will land on a screen to guide you through setup.
For this project you do not have to do anything here.
We are not using anything
like Copilot, but you are free to explore and customize your setup
it if you want:
![VSCode Setup](.assets/vscode-setup.png)
1. Install the necessary extensions to the VSCode environment:
    1. Click the extensions icon on the toolbar. ![Extensions](./.assets/extensions-button.png)
    1. In the *Search Extensions in Marketplace* input field, one at a time, search for
    the following four extensions: Microsoft Python, Microsoft Python Debugger, Microsoft Live Share, and
    Ritwik Dey Liver Server:
    ![Required Extensions](./.assets/extensions.png)
    1. As you find each one, look for an *install* or *uninstall* button.
    If you find an install button, click it to install the extension.
    Hint: installing the Python extension should include the debugger extension too.
    ![Extension Install](./.assets/extensions-install.png)
1. In this project at GitHub click
    the *Fork* button to copy this repository to your own GitHub account:
    ![Fork Repository](./.assets/fork-repository.png)
1. In your own copy of the repository, click on the green *Code* button, make sure the *Local*
    tab is selected, and copy the URL.
    If you set up SSH you will see github@github.com: URL, otherwise it will be an https:// URL:
    ![GitHub Clone](.assets/github-clone.png)
1. Back in VSCode click on the *Source Control* toolbar icon, then the *Clone Repository*
    button in the panel, and paste the repository URL into the input box that appears and
    press the return/enter key.
    You will be prompted for a folder to put the clone in; it wants a projects folder
    that will contain the new repository folder:
    ![VSCode Clone Repository](.assets/vscode-clone-repository.png)
1. When VSCode asks if you want to open the new repository choose yes.
1. In VSCode open an the embedded terminal window with the *View &rarr; Terminal* menu option.
1. Create a local Python virtual environment in the project folder.
Remember that $ is the command prompt, and you may need to substitute your python command name
(*python3* or *py* ) for *python* in this example:
    ```
    $ python -m venv .venv
    $ . .venv/bin/activate        # MacOS or Linux
    $ .venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
    ```
1. Use the Python package manager *pip* to install the Python modules necessary for this project:
    ```
    $ python -m pip install coverage selenium webdriver_manager mock flask python-dotenv
    ```
1. You may have seen a "toast" popup window asking you to confirm the new virtual environment
python as the interpreter and confirmed that.
If you did not, use the *View &rarr; Command Palette...* menu option to open the command palette.
Enter and pick when available in the drop-down list *Python: Select Interpreter*, and then in the
next window pick the interpreter in the *./.venv/bin* folder (it should be labeled *recommended*):
    ![Python Select Interpreter](.assets/python-select-interpreter.png)
1. On the toolbar click the run-debug icon ![Run-Debug](./.assets/run-debug.png)
1. At the top right of the panel select the configuration *Main*, and then click
the run arrow to the left of the dropdown:

    ![Run-Debug-Launch-Configuration](./.assets/run-debug-launch-configuration.png)
    
1. In the terminal panel that opened look for the output line beginning with "Application starting on...":
    ```
    Application starting on http://localhost:3000/
    ```
1. Cmd/ctrl-click the URL (cmd on a Mac, ctrl on Windows or Linux) to launch the browser page.
1. Verify the application works and shows the logo and message:

    ![Verify](./.assets/verify-image.png)

1. Close the browser page.
1. Find the debug controls and click the red-bordered stop button to terminate the application.
By default they float at the top-center of the VSCode
application, but you can move them anywhere you like with the drag bar on the left:
![Run-Debug-Stop](./.assets/run-debug-stop.png)
1. Congratulations, everything is set to start!
Follow this link for [a tour of VSCode and how Microsoft Live Share will be used](https://cleancoderscollaborative.github.io/vscode/).

## Option 2: Develop in a GitHub Codespace

You will need your own GitHub account for this option, the first step is to make your
own copy of the repository.
GitHub Codespaces are Docker containers running on servers at GitHub.
When you launch a Codespace it is on a specific branch, by default "main".
Any work you do in the Codespace is abandoned unless you commit the work back to the branch.

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account:
    ![Fork Repository](./.assets/fork-repository.png)

1. In the new repository, click the Code button, select the Codespaces tab, and create a new Codespace
on the *main* branch.
1. A new Docker container will be created at GitHub with a random name like "solid-sniffle-6pp459r6j53qg6".
1. A copy of VSCode will be launched as a single-page application in your browser, and will be
connected to the Docker container where the project will be developed.
1. Wait for the last command to run in the terminal panel at the screen bottom (your
username will be different):
    ```
    . ./.devcontainer/postAttachCommand.sh
    @jmussman â /workspaces/mastermind (main) $ . ./.devcontainer/postAttachCommand.sh
    ```
1. On the toolbar click the run-debug icon ![Run-Debug](./.assets/run-debug.png)
1. At the top right of the panel select the configuration *Main*, and then click
the run arrow to the left of the dropdown:

    ![Run-Debug-Launch-Configuration](./.assets/run-debug-launch-configuration.png)

1. In the terminal panel that opened look for the output line beginning with "Application starting on...".
It will have a funny name (different from this one):
    ```
    Application starting on https://solid-sniffle-6pp459r6j53qg6-3000.app.github.dev/
    ```
1. Cmd/ctrl-click the URL (cmd on a Mac, ctrl on Windows or Linux) to launch the browser page.
You may get a message about connecting to a port on another user's Codespace, that happens because
third-party cookies are not enabled.
Ignore it, and move on.
1. Verify the application works and shows the logo and message:

    ![Verify](./.assets/verify-image.png)

1. Close the browser page.
1. Find the debug controls and click the red-bordered stop button to terminate the application: ![Run-Debug-Stop](./.assets/run-debug-stop.png)
1. Congratulations, everything is set to start!
Follow this link for [a tour of VSCode and how Microsoft Live Share will be used](https://cleancoderscollaborative.github.io/vscode/).

### Notes:

* The container is always launched on a specific code branch.
If you are creating branches for specific backlog tasks, make sure you pick the right branch when launching the Codespace.
* Codespaces are not infinite; you can only have so many, and even fewer running simultanesouly.
* Codespaces will self-destruct after too many days idle.
* Codespaces work on their own clone of the branch.
Make sure you save and commit changes to the repository in your GitHub account if you want to keep your work before
the Codespace is destroyed.
* The limits on free Codespace use may be found here: https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts.

## Project Overview

This is a traditional web application.
This project does not need to introduce the learning curve of a specific single-page application
framework to contend with.
All of that may come later.

This project has a given layout to avoid refocusing on how to structure the work.
For small projects a structure based on the purpose of components is sufficient, which is how
this project is laid out.
For larger projects typically folks break it down by features and then the component purpose under the feature.

The argument about singular vs plural namining conventions will never be settled :)

```
src/
  main.py
  assets/
    images/
    script/
    style/
  SayHello/
  viewTemplates/
test/
  acceptance/
  integration/
  unit/
    SayHello/
```

## Testing

The project is blessed with a group of unit and integration tests.
These are examples supporting the Flask framework the project will be built around and the initial home page.
The intention is to provide a template for creating tests during test-driven development while the project is on-going, especially when folks are not that familiar with Python unittest.

### Running Tests

There are several ways to launch the tests:

1. Click on the toolbar icon for testing, and launch the tests from there.
Every test suite and individual test has buttons to run or debug:

    ![VSCode Test](.assets/vscode-tests.png)

1. Click on the run-debug toolbar icon and in the panel select the launch configuration
for *All Tests* or *Coverage All Tests* and run the tests:

    ![VSCode Test](.assets/vscode-run-tests.png)

1. Run the tests from the command line in the terminal window ($ is the prompt).
The first command discovers and runs all the tests, the second with code-coverage,
the third a particular test suite, and the fourth a particular test suite for coverage
(in this case the unit tests for main):

    ```
    $ python -m unittest discover -s test -v
    $ python -m coverage run --source=src -m unittest discover -s test -v; python -m coverage report
    $ python -m unittest test/unit/test_TestMain.py -v  
    $ python -m coverage run --source=src -m unittest test/unit/test_TestMain.py -v  
    ```

### Testing Modules in Isolation

A problem arises when the client code you are testing imports its own dependencies.
An obvious solution to this is never import anything and inject everything.
That is unrealisitic, because the core modules that are included with Python and plenty of add-on modules
are valid dependencies.
But what about unit testing in isolation?

In testing frameworks we rely on facilities to "hoist" established mocks before any code loads the dependencies.
Unfortunately Python to does not provide any mechanisim to hoist.
And the first code to load a module locks that module in, every other piece of code loads that identity.

On the other hand, Python is a dynamic language and nothing stops any code from making changes to any object during
run-time.
So, we can easily replace components of modules on the fly with mocks for testing.
The issue is that in some circumstances the code under test (CUT) has to be forced to reload the module to see the
mocks instead of the original components.
But it is possible.

The module *test/unit/test_TestMain.py* is one example where this is done, and all of the documentation about how
to make it happen is in that file.

### Unit Testing

Test controllers and services.

Unit tests for model data is not really neccessary, it should just be data structures.
Functionality should be in a service module, not in the model.

Unit tests for views end up just testing the Flask template rendering engine.
View content testing belongs in acceptance testing.

If a persistent data source is added, testing that whould just test the persistence engine.

### Integration Testing

Integration testing is limited to the services.

If the controllers just make decisions about dispatching as they should,
the decision-making process is already covered in the controller unit tests.
Testing the controllers would just be testing the Flask routing engine, and that should
be an acceptance test issue.

For the same reason that we do not do unit tests for model and persistent data, they will be
picked up through the integration tests of the services.

### Acceptance Testing

Selenium is the core for end-to-end acceptance testing.
To control the environment, The Werkzeug WSGI server is used for a clean startup and
shutdown.

At the beginning of the tests the application will launch in a headless browser, the default configuration is
for Chrome but the test may be changed.
Standard Selenium features are used to request server interaction and examine results.


## Git Notes

There are many ways to use git, and just as many arguments about what is the best way to manage a development project.
Some folks argue that there should only be one branch in a shared repository and everybody pushes their
commits to that branch.
But, if there are multiple teams AND/OR a requirement for pull requests and
formal code reviews (strongly encouraged) a single branch will not work.

In order to perform a pull request and the associated code review, the code either needs to be on a separate branch
in the same repository in a completely different repository.
For Mastermind this will have to be in your own repository because we are not granting write access to
the source repository.
Teams are free to share such a repository while they work and do with it as they please.

Your repository should have a development branch (it could be named something else).
You and any other team members may use this as a single branch to push commits to.
Or, as many projects provide you can use separate feature branches for individuals, pairs, and mobs to do their work on.
Remember, you will work on the branch on your local computer, and push commits to the remote
repository frequently so other members of the team can see that work and merge it with their local copies.
Passing unit tests before a commit and a push is desirable.

![Git Release Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleancoderscollaborative/cdn/main/images/git-feature-branch.jpg)

In the real world feature branches names are often composed from the issue tracking code for the feature
and a descriptive task name.
If you are using a single branch, name it after your team.
The name provides accountability for what was done in the Git history of the main repository
when pull requests are merged.

When you are working on a specific feature, try to limit
making any changes to other areas of the code the feature may depend on.
This will minimize merge-conflicts during pull requests.
It is better if you can ask whoever is responsible for that area to make the
changes for you on their copy and then you can merge that with your branch.

![Git Release Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleancoderscollaborative/cdn/main/images/git-release-flow.jpg)

In the real world, the end of the main branch should contain the last stable release
of the product, and previous merge points are the previous stable releases.
If the main branch is constantly being updated and undergoing testing as some
teams try to do, it is harder to work backwards to find the last stable release.

It is recommended to do integration testing and exceptance testing on a branch
devoted to that purpose.
The testing branch could be a branch in the main repository, a branch pulled from a second
repository, or very likely a combination of both when forked repositories are necessary for teams.
When tests pass and a release is set, merge that to the main branch to keep track of it.

### SSH Keys

SSH uses a private-public key-pair to both establish the authenticity of one party and start encrypted communications.
The key-pair of assymetric encryption provides that data encrypted with either key may only be decrypted with the other.
The public key will be registered with the GitHub account.

When a connection is started GitHub sends a challenge message that must be returned encrypted with the user's private key.
If the message decrypted with the public key is the same, then it must be the user (or someone else who has gained access to the private key).

The private key should be protected, and is stored in the .ssh folder under the user's home directory.
The *git* command will automatically try to use the private key it finds there to establish the connection,
so this is tremendously both easier and more secure than entering a password each time.

To set this up a private-public key-pair must be established, and the public key registered with the GitHub account.
See the documentation below in [*Git Resources*](#git-resources).
